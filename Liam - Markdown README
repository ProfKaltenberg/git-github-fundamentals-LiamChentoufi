## Liam's Next Steps, My Markdown
* I enjoyed this classroom Readme, I've forked it to save it as another resource moving forward. There seem to be many options to copy or save a main repository, I'll need to practice to get used to each of them. This time around I used the GitHub UI to complete my requests but I hope to practice more with the Terminal commands. They feel much quicker and there is something satisfying about using Terminal to do the work. I look forward to our next lesson!

I created a Profile README at https://github.com/LiamChentoufi!

I created my first repository at https://github.com/LiamChentoufi/First-Repository, I am currently having trouble pushing changes to it with local files but I will continue to test it out.

In regard to GitHub Classroom's last question in the Next Steps portion, I don't think there is anything they should change with this walkthrough. I find it very detailed and clear, I enjoyed the addition of links to further resources if we decide to spend more time on a particular section.
